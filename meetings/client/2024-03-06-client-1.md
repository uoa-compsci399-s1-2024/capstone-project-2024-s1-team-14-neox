Time: 10am
Location: Zoom, 201-393
Participants: 

## Agenda
1. Introduce group
2. Clarify project scope
3. Build understanding 

## Notes



### Background
Work on myopia
Lot of children who develop short sightnessess
If it develops too much, affects vision later in life
Spending time outdoors slows progression

Diificult monitoring how much time spent outdoors
Prevent myopia by 2 hours outdoor 

Question: How can the parent know how much time spend outdoors

Light monitor = talk to the parents phone
Basis of the project: develop a software for the parents phone to recieve information

Need monitoring, cloud to access the data

Provide money for equipment
Phone app to talk to the device
Don't have the device, some other microprocessor
Worn as a watch as a photo type tracker = even as plugged in 

UV sensor = outdoor light 

Need to differentiate between indoors and outdoors
Actual light level is not that imporant

Engcourage people to stay inside

Arduino sensor to connect 

WIfi connection

Raw data = sampling, have to poll, at local storage, poll to the cloud
Summary of how many hours, spend outside

Web interface: export function for research 

Need login for the parent to see how much hours they spent over a month

Affect the choice of the development tools


Minimum
= cellphone based app

Happy to start of with an android only system

Like to see: some kind of progress, restricted to android system


Prototyping of the device, some decisions, for familiar
Light sensors that plug into arduino

Have no experience: familiar with arduino type processes

Ultimate aim: sufficient battery life, probably need an interemediate device
more common to sync to a mobile device 

Ethical = not really good to send data from the child to the cloud

Are there any technical requirements: don't have skills
front-end: doesn't need to be beautiful, just numbers are fine

Stretch goals = visualisation

Main objective: visible light, issue = outside under cover, window insight, alternate = measure uv levels
both sensors to calibrate, 

Mulitfactorial
- cicadian rhythm
- best time to recieve is midday
- would we want to know the time of day the child has received light
- Big population group = family history, overall look at refractive 
Indoors = 
Outdoors = visible horizon, distance issue

Wanting to know if the child is outdoors or not, 
cloudy days still very bright, orders of magnitude brighter outside than insight

No tracking with location gps lock from inside, it may not be that helpful for school environemnt, in playgroud immediate to the classroom
Privacy issues

Core functions: convert to hardware

Measuring uv and actual visual light level is somethign to carry forward
some literature on light sensing

Problem: have no idea how much the parent has been outdoors, want to know so to encourage the student to go outdoors

When the information be gathered, or through drastic levels in uv rays?
Frequent polling
Or trigger, event based capture, analysis - changes in location
How to detect the child has modified


Difference is very obvious, rarely 1000 indoors, 1000 lux outdoors even on rain
-> have a meter to get the output for lux

Investigating the uv sensor indoors, difference in uv levels is even more marked, a much larger step difference

Target = younger children, almost know where exactly where they are
go home at the end of the day

Long term effect - my feeling, an occasional, data goes to parent phone

"You haven't be outside for 14 hours", just the analysis at the end of the data


store data = minimal, don't want to fill out, just the time of change?
only sync a few days 

temperature sensor, check if on or not, accelerator?
Detecting change on the device is great, detect that the device was stationary, don't collect until movement

Sleep mode? Catch data only when there is movement

Battery life

How often be free for meetups and checkups?

Prototype: communcate by email
Somebody must have access to the piece of hardware
First decision = is arduino the best platform?

First couple of weeks, every week

Grafton based 

Budget = we provide money to buy the products

screen for the sensor

Hardware will be best 

More important it works for used = don't get lowest price

For each team
A lot of problem will be shared, have two meetings at the time slot, 
and organise, same zoom link

Useful transfer of information, share the zoom meetings
publicly available

Great to see how the other team is approaching the problem
Learning opportunity for everyone

Can respond to emails 

Scope of the project


## After meeting discussion

### Hardware
Embedded
- STM
- Rasbery Pi Pico
Doesn't matter to much about the board

Things we need
- UVB = indoors
- lux (light sensor)
- accelerator
- screen (need to get protocol)
- debugging
- storage component? 
Protocals = i2c, spi, how they communicate

How to communicate
- talking: bluetooth le -> parents phone
	- might need to poll with bluetooth
- screen



Send all the raw samples over
-> Later optimise 


Transferirng the data, JSON? for the raw data

Send an array:
1. how long the array is

Might need make for us

Distance send laser out? ultra sound? light 1000lux
accelrator: have you moved

Threshold off = no motion for 10 minutes


3d printer to print 
Timestamps: do they have a clock 


Battery = it won't keep track of time
= Save data on persistence board, at most 64kb
= otherwise compress the data to just record changes
Time intervals = know how much seconds have passed



### Roles
Development: 3 teams
1. hardware
2. app
3. cloud web 

Start working on the phone app

Simulate the hardware with another device



### Phone app/web interface
1. what codebase for the database

## Decisions
Milestones
1. Decide hardware 
2. Get BLE to work, make it transfer data



## Action Items
- Research hardware that is capable of detecting indoors and outdoors
- Frameworks for phone app
	- no specific framework, as long as communicating with ble
- Calculate memory required
- Organise github repository: 3 different repositiories
- Decide roles
- Set milestones

## Next Meeting
Group meeting: 6 March, 2:45pm on Discord
