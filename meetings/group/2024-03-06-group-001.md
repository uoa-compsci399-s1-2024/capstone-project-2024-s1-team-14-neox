4. screen
### Event detection
Covered = if light drops below certain 


### Roles

Same repository
Master branch = for every feature, create main branch, 
Different people work on disjoint parts

## Decision
Go with Arduino
Classification:  processing on the app, raw data t
## Action
1. Ask about how small the prototype should be
2. Send an email on Friday on the scope of the hardware price
	1. automatic or manual: press a button to sync the data
	2. clarify raw data for the specialists
3. Git commit matches the title
4. New feature, new branch, merge at the end
5. three folders for arduino, app, website
6. Ask reference style for Anna
